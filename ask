Foreach containers, I want you to extract all of this selectors text elements, and you to do this:
- Inside the `company` selector, there is a company name and an employment type, that are seperated only by a `·` I want you to seperate those two, and put it to the respective key in the exprience object. And for the employment type, there can be : Full-Time, Part-Time, Freelance, Self-Employed, Contract, Internship, Temporary, Volunteer, Apprenticehip, Seasonal 
- Inside the `date` selector, there is startDate and endDate, that are seperated by a `-`, and there is also a duration that are seperated using `·`, so the format is somethign like this: Apr 2027 - Jul 2045 · 18 yr 3 mos. I want you to put that into its own key on the experience object
